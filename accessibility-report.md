## Target Audience
We would market the program towards kids and young adults who have interest in sports analytics or basketball. The essence of our program is to make a fun game that people can use to test their knowledge about basketball using past statistics of an NBA player. This program is a great way to see if you can understand the fundamentals of sports data as it only has the very basic metrics such as field goal percentage and total offensive rebounds but when there are actually tons of metrics out there for sports data. This also a great alternative to sports betting and gambling because you definitely don’t want to get a the younger generation into that stuff.

## Demographic Considerations
We designed HoopsHub to be inclusive and accessible for everyone, regardless of age, gender, race, or class. However, we acknowledge that individuals with certain disabilities may face challenges such as those who are blind or visually impaired may find it difficult to engage with the program. One thing we can implement in the future is screen reader compatibility and add audio descriptions of the data to better accommodate for everyone. We also acknowledge that basketball is predominantly played and followed by men, however this does not mean that women are excluded from using the program. Another feature or aspect that we can do to encourage more women to engage with the program is to get data from the WNBA by utilizing a WNBA-specific API. This could broaden the program's appeal to everyone more and make a more inclusive environment for all.
